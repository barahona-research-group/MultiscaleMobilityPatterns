Code for the paper "Multiscale mobility patterns and the restriction of human movement" by Dominik J Schindler, Jonathan M Clarke and Mauricio Barahona: https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06323

## Data access

### Facebook Movement Maps

Data used in this study was accessed through Facebook's "Data for Good" program: https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/movement-maps. We use the raw data only in our first notebook, where we compute baseline and daily mobility networks for the UK (see paper) that can be used to reproduce all results in this study. This derivative data is available in the `data/processed/networks` directory.

### Geographic shape files

Shape files for the UK Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), January 2018, used in this study are obtained from the Office for National Statistics licensed under the Open Government Licence v.3.0 and contain OS data Â© Crown copyright and database right 2023: https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/nuts3-jan-2018-super-generalised-clipped-boundaries-in-the-uk/explore

We also annotate geographic maps with UK city names licensed under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/): https://simplemaps.com/data/gb-cities,
